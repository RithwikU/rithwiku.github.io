I am an individual who thrives on being constantly engaged and busy. Embracing a proactive approach to life, I eagerly take on numerous projects and extracurricular activities, allowing me to constantly juggle my time and remain in motion. I have a genuine passion for exploring new endeavors and am always seeking opportunities for growth and learning. This drive for continuous improvement is evident in the diverse range of projects and courses I am currently undertaking as part of my master's program at the University of Pennsylvania. By embracing a multifaceted approach to my education and personal development, I aim to broaden my horizons and make the most of every opportunity that comes my way.
