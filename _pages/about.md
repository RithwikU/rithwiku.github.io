I am a person that always likes to be busy and engaged in something. I tend to take up a lot of projects and extracurricular activities that make me juggle my time and always remain on the move. I enjoy exploring new things and am constantly seeking learning opportunities. This is portrayed by the variety of projects and courses I am doing as part of my master's at the University of Pennsylvania.
