The cleaning industry is facing significant challenges due to its labor-intensive nature and the growing demand for services that exceed the capacity of many companies. Cleaning large open spaces can be time-consuming and often inefficient, leading to a loss of productivity for the company and its staff. To enhance the productivity of businesses and enable the staff to focus on intricate tasks requiring human attention, an innovative solution is required to automate the repetitive and tedious task of cleaning large open spaces.

We worked around the clock talking to experts from the cleaning industry, experts on robotics, and
our peers to incorporate novel and challenging features into our product. We were successful in
making a working prototype and have exciting plans lined up for the future. Our product is equipped
with a multitude of sensors, enabling us to analyze patterns of waste accumulation and identify
their locations. This information can assist authorities in placing dustbins in appropriate locations,
thereby combating littering. Segregation after collection is a time-consuming and laborious task
that we plan to streamline by segregating during collection. We also intend to develop an intuitive
graphical user interface that will facilitate the selection of initial geofencing locations, display
waste collection statistics, and generate heat maps highlighting areas of high litter density. Our
coverage algorithm can then adapt the path based on litter density, allowing for a fast and efficient
cleaning process. While our prototype is currently optimized for use in park settings, our vision is
to develop add-ons tailored to various terrains and harsh climates. The future of SauberBOT appears
"clean" and the entire team is excited to take this forward.
