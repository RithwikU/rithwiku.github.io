### AI-driven soft toy for detecting and classifying infant interactions using optical force sensors to detect neurodevelopmental delays

It is crucial to identify neurodevelopmental disorders in infants early on for timely intervention to improve their long-term outcomes. Combining natural play with quantitative measurements of developmental milestones can be an effective way to swiftly and efficiently detect infants who are at risk of developmental delays.  Clinical studies have established differences in toy interaction behaviors between healthy infants and those at risk for developmental delays. The proposed smart toy aims to enhance the quantitative assessment of infant toy interactions in order to detect risks of developing motor delays. This article describes the design and development of a smart toy that uniquely utilizes a collection of soft lossy force sensors to gather natural interaction data from infants. By analyzing patterns of interaction with the toy and identifying distinct action types from the data, this toy shows promise in classifying interactions.
